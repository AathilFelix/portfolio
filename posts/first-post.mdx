## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive guide! In this post, we'll explore **everything** you need to know about building a modern blog. Let's dive in.

---

## Getting Started
First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. You'll also need a basic understanding of *React* and ***TypeScript***.

> The best way to learn is by doing. — Someone wise

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of React
- Familiarity with the command line

### Installation Steps

1. Create a new Next.js project
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Configure Tailwind CSS
4. Set up your MDX pipeline
5. Create your first blog post

---

## Code Examples

Here's how you define a simple TypeScript function:

```typescript
interface Post {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  author: string | string[];
}

function getPostBySlug(slug: string): Post {
  // Fetch and return the post
  return {
    title: "My Post",
    date: "25-12-2025",
    author: "Aathil Felix"
  };
}
```

For inline code, you can use `const x = 10` or reference files like `posts.ts`.

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greet("World");
```

### CSS Example

```css
.prose {
  --tw-prose-body: hsl(var(--foreground));
  max-width: 65ch;
}
```

### Shell Commands

```bash
npm install next-mdx-remote gray-matter
npm run dev
```

You can also use Next.js Image component for optimization (requires custom MDX components).
